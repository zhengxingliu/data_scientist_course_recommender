"Chercheuse/Chercheur scientifique, recherche appliquée / Applied Research Scientist - Doc Intel - Platform",Element AI,"Montréal, QC"," Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables. 
 Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA. 
 Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission. 
 Vous avez une expérience en vision par ordinateur et en apprentissage automatique classique. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie. 
 Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis. 
 Vous êtes pragmatique et comprenez que la solution technique appropriée pour résoudre un problème est celle qui apportera de la valeur à notre client, que ce soit un algorithme d'apprentissage automatique classique qui a fait ses preuves ou un algorithme d'apprentissage profond à la fine pointe. 
 Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons. 
 Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : préparation et nettoyage de données, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, techniques d'apprentissage automatique classiques pour les problèmes de classification, techniques d'apprentissage profond pour la vision par ordinateur, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème d'apprentissage automatique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

 You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs. 
 You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical machine learning methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI. 
 Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission. 
 You have experience with computer vision and classical machine learning algorithms. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks. 
 You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it. 
 You are pragmatic and understand that the right technical solution to a problem is the one that brings value to the customer, whether it is a tried-and-tested classical machine learning algorithm or a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm. 
 You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer. 
 The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as data preparation & cleaning, feature engineering, various classical machine learning techniques for classification, deep learning techniques for computer vision, etc. If you have experience solving a machine learning problem end to end, then you'll fit right in! 
 Work closely with other AI enthusiasts; 
 Enjoy your work and life harmony; 
 Leave your mark in a thriving industry; 
 Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday; 
 Be surprised at how much you will learn;
